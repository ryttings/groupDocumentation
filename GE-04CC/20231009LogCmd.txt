REM Begin GE04 Section 2
REM Opened browser and navigated to the following pages
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp
REM Used for h1 heading, p name, and h3 subheading
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp
REM Used for unordered list (for bullet points) and items
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp
REM Used to surround our a/hyperlink tags with an href/url,
REM  and a target/behavior, with our href/text rendered/cickable
REM Included target attribute options in a comment within the HTML code
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp
REM Relevant to our static UCCS logo
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp
REM Will soon be relevant to rendering data surrounded on all sides with borders
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_comments.asp
REM Used to add comments to HTML code, both inline and section/block applications applied
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_link
REM Used to initially test the W3Schools HTML Online Editor Code.html webpage rendering
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
REM Used to review input options for our users

REM Begin GE04 Section 3
REM https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp
REM Used to review Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) application to our HTML Structure
REM, class to HTML tag coordinated CSS/HTML pairs, with applied attributes
REM https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_div.asp
REM Used to containerize lines of HTML code to control execution/rendering
REM In our case, we use div tags to surround code we want styled, and additionally
REM  this page demonstrates a custom CSS class, to apply attibutes to sections of code,
REM  without our class to html tag pair, 1 advantage and 1 disadvantage of this below:
REM  Advantage-custom code for the same tags in different areas of our HTML
REM  Disadvantage-must be manually applied and customized, whereas our pairs are a pattern
REM  Paired and custom CSS classes both help scale style applications and reduce errors
REM   either way.
REM https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.php
REM Used to define custom classes, and include the required reference
REM  to them inline from our HTML code
REM https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp
REM Further demonstration of the reference for a custom class
REM https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_buttons_basic
REM Used to develop our HTML code with styles (a separate CSS file is alternately available locally)
REM https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_comments.asp
REM Used to apply line by line necessary comments in CSS, both inline and block options
REM Note: The .button class is required for example, but an h2 class can be a CSS/HTML pair.
REM  This is required for individual application of the styling, especially to user input elements
REM  The main reason is the style is applied differently when button is called because the type
REM  attribute is changed per button (of the original 4), and will have different instances,
REM  Whereas the class allows the attributes to be inherited, even though the types will make each
REM  button its own instance. h2 Does not have this problem, it is not a specifically instantiated element

REM Begin GE04 Section 4

REM Will refer to this last week's PowerPoint slides
