Create Admin Panel

Run the code “ manage.py createsuperuser “, however this was not working for me and I got the error: 
“ Superuser creation skipped due to not running in a TTY. You can run `manage.py createsuperuser` in your project to create one manually.”

Then ran " winpty python manage.py createsuperuser “ which created the superuser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
